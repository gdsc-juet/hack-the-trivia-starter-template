# Mapify

## Introduction

Mapify is an open-source solution designed for e-commerce platforms, enabling a seamless integration of mapping functionalities critical for buyers and sellers. With the use of open-source maps, the platform supports various operations such as polygon creation, route generation, reverse-geocoding, distance computation, and dynamic mapping. Our solution contributes to democratizing the e-commerce space by leveraging cost-effective, scalable, and versatile mapping technologies including GPS coordinates, Google S2 cells, and Uber H3 cells.

## Features

- **Polygon(s) Creation**: Generate custom-defined areas for delivery zones or service coverage.
- **Motorable Paths Generation**: Determine the best possible navigational routes between buyer and seller locations.
- **Reverse-Geocoding**: Convert physical addresses to precise geographical points on the map.
- **Distance Computation**: Calculate the motorable distance between two points for logistics planning.
- **Interactive Mapping**: Map points to polygons or paths interactively or through API calls.
- **Multiple Representations**: Support for various geocoding standards to ensure compatibility and precision.
