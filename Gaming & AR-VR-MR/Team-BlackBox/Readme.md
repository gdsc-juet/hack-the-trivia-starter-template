# Physimatch

## Project Description

Physimatch is a dynamic physics game designed to enhance the memorization of complex formulae. Users construct equations using Latin and Greek letters, alongside mathematical symbols, earning points based on formula length. The game features a 40-second timer, with each matched formula providing an additional 5 seconds of playtime. Strategic thinking is crucial, as points are deducted incrementally with each swipe. Physimatch offers a unique and enjoyable approach to mastering physics through interactive gameplay.

## Real-World Problem and Solution

Recalling specific physics formulae in education is a common challenge. Physimatch addresses this by transforming learning into a gamified experience. It solves the difficulty students face in retaining complex formulas. By integrating memorization with entertainment, Physimatch not only reinforces understanding but also makes learning enjoyable. Additionally, the language switch feature to Hindi enhances accessibility, making the game more inclusive.
